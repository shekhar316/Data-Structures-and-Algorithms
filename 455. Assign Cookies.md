# 455. Assign Cookies - Leetcode

> https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/description/

## Description
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.
Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; 
and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, 
and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

```
Example 1:
Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.

Example 2:
Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.

Constraints:
1 <= g.length <= 3 * 104
0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104
1 <= g[i], s[j] <= 231 - 1
```

## Approach

* Our goal is to determine the maximum number of content children efficiently. 
* We aim to allocate the smallest possible cookie to each child, preserving larger cookies for children with greater contentment.
* The mapping principle is to associate the smallest greed with the smallest cookie.

* To achieve this, we employ a two-pointer approach after sorting the arrays.
* One pointer tracks the sizes of cookies, and the other identifies the current child's contentment level.
* The algorithm checks whether the current cookie size can satisfy the contentment of the child at the child pointer,
* content[childIndex] >= cookies_size[cookieIndex].
* If the above condition holds true, we increment the childIndex and contentChildren.
* This method ensures an efficient and optimal distribution of cookies to maximize contentment among children.

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        int contentChildren = 0;
        int cookieIndex = 0;
        int childIndex = 0;
        int children = g.length;
        int cookies = s.length;

        Arrays.sort(s);
        Arrays.sort(g);

        while(cookieIndex < cookies && childIndex < children){
            if(s[cookieIndex] >= g[childIndex]){
                contentChildren++;
                childIndex++;
            }
            cookieIndex++;
        }

        return contentChildren;
    }
}
```
